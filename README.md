This is my personal blog. You can access the blog [here](http://psuteparuk.github.io/potchyblog).

The site is generated through a static site generator called **Jekyll** ([repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)). I utilize the **Jekyll Now** platform ([repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)) and **dbyle** theme ([repo](https://github.com/dbtek/dbyll)).
